# DFA Simulator

This program simulates a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). It allows users to define a DFA by specifying its alphabet, states, initial state, final state, and transition table. The program can then test whether a given word is accepted or rejected by the DFA.

## Features
- Define your custom DFA by:
  - Specifying the alphabet.
  - Configuring the number of states.
  - Setting the initial and final states.
  - Creating a transition table interactively.
- Test words to check if they are accepted or rejected by the defined DFA.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to define your DFA:
   - Enter the alphabet as a single string of characters (e.g., `abc`).
   - Specify the number of states (e.g., if you enter `3`, the states will be `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`).
   - Define the initial state and final state by entering their respective indices.
   - Enter the transitions for each state and symbol in the alphabet.
3. After defining the DFA, test words using the specified alphabet.
   - Type a word and the program will determine if it is accepted or rejected.
   - Type `exit` to end the program.
